1)mkvirtual env
2) activate
3) install django
4)django-admin startprohject prjname
5) startapp
6)think about the design requirements ---> we will be making two apps : courses and users .
courses app --> division , subject , lesson ,  comments 
users --> custom user model ( trader , emoloyee, senior trader )

Then there are user specific permissions inside the application -- adding ,deleting,updating 

7) include urls for each of the application users
8) make views...which return an httpresponse

User_info Model :
   this uses User model and maps oneToOneField...then bio , profile pic , user type choice field to select one type..then string display of the object

Now create a media folder...make setting for this so that django stores pictures in the meida folder...generally media files must be kept on a separate server...for durabilit
for image we need pillow package 

Register the model in the admin interface

trader can be registered only by the admin 
However employee and senior trader need to create account 

We would in fact create forms using django model forms that can be used to create new forms ...using inbuilt models or new models ...

Now we will create the views...each for different pages...register, login , etc....we will be using authenticate . login, logout 

in the registration view..check for the post method..then use the forms pass them to the template and return render the template 

authenticate uses password username  
user.is_active
responseRedirect 

login(request, user) is used to log in the user 

logout view to logout the user from the application ...we can usee the login_required decorator 

use of csrf token is used when we are submitting form in post mehtod 

same origin policy 
cors - cross origin resource sharing 
csrf -- cross site resoruce forgery 
preflight request

in template u can do conditional rendering of template
